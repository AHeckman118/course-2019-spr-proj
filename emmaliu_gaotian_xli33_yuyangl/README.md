# CS504 Project #1 - Mapping Amman
***This project is a part of BU Spark! project “Mapping Amman”.***

## Introduction
Betty Anderson is conducting an ethnography of present-day Amman, Jordan, to determine how 22-35 year olds with university degrees, who are living in representative neighborhoods around the city are navigating the neoliberal development projects financed by the state.  In just the last two decades, Amman has doubled in size, and schooling, jobs and entertainment have been privatized (i.e. no longer funded by the government, so the rules and regulations of any given establishment can be set by the independent owner). The youth population is the first generation to be fully immersed in this new city, facing its new obstacles and opportunities. Betty would like to compare the life, work and social trajectories she sees in her qualitative data from her interviews with quantitative data that can come from examining social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, and Open Spaces.

2 big topics to guide the project:

- Using the intersection of social media and mapping, where do people spend their time? Is it feasible to get to these places, and are these places conducive to networking and socializing in affordable ways? Are people happy when they are in these places? If not, what are the conditions when they are not happy?

- Can we find a relationship between university degrees, skills, language, and English training centers, and whether or not a person in Amman has a job?

## Milestone #1
- Scrape data from social media and store it into MongoDB.
- Do some data transformation.
- Discuss results with the project partner.

## Our work

### Scrape Data
Following the two topics mentioned above, out first step is scraping data since we are not provided with data sets from the project partner. We decided to get data from Twitter and LinkedIn.
