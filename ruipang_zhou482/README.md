<Project 1>
We chose five datasets from Analyse Boston: Property Assessment, Police Station, Public School, Private School and Hospitals. We are trying to develop a relationship between the average house price in each zipcode area and the number of Police station, schools and hospitals in that area. Each dataset will be transformed in the form {"zipcode": xxxxxx, "value": xxxxxx}, where the value is average house price for Property Assessments and number of corresponding facilities in this area. In this form we can find a relationship between housing price and number of public facilities.




<Project 2>
	Our problem is to find a correlation between Average house price in each zipcode and the number of public facilities in this region (ex. Police Station, School, Hospital). We will divide the problem into 2 parts:
		1. Develop a linear function to predict average house price using existing data. We solve this problem as a optimization problem. We define our linear function as y=w*x+b where y is the actual price, w is the weight vector, b is the bias and x is the existing data. We define the cost function of our linear function to be MSE = (1/N)âˆ‘(yi - (w * xi + b)). In our problem, we want to minimize this cost to get the best linear function to predict average house price. We employ linear regression package from scikit-learn to minimize the cost and derive the linear function for prediction.

		2. Compute the correlation between number of each facility to the housing price. Todo
