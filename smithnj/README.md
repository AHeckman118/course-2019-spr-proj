# Dyanmic Chicago Transit Fares

## Proposal
The city of Chicago is the third largest city in the United States. Like other urban areas, it has a relatively robust transit network connecting the city and the surrounding suburbs. The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) is tasked with management of the Chicago bus and the elevated-rail ('L') networks. It opts for a static fare, independent of distance traveled within the network and other possible variables unlike a city such as London, which has designated zones for determining fare. The Metra commuter rail, which serves the greater Northwestern Illinois area, does use a distance-based fare. But what if the CTA took an approach similar to Metra rail, but also taking into account "surge" style pricing and promoting transit in lower-income areas?
