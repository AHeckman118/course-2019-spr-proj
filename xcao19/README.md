Datasets used:
- AirBNB listings
- AirBNB neighborhoods
- AnalyzeBoston crime incident reports from Aug 2015 until present
- AnalyzeBoston streetlight locations
- AnalyzeBoston police station
- Zillow average home values for various neighborhoods in the US

These 5 data sets all contain information about the characteristics of various locations within the US. With AnalyzeBoston's data combined with the other data sets, we can generate a specific set of attributes per location which can help answer questions about average AirBNB rates, average restaurant ratings/cuisine varieties, and safety of each location. As a graduating student, these are key pieces of information that I would use to identify the convenience, safety, and cost of living across the Boston area. By looking at the data provided, a person who is unfamiliar with the Boston area could make calculated decisions about which areas of Boston best suit their needs. For example, a person who was hesitant to walk to a restaurant at night could use the information about streetlights, crime, and cuisine options to determine good evening dining locations to try out.
