4) Crime Rate and 5) Boston Police
To see which areas of Boston are safer, we use the Department of Innovation and Technology's Crime Incident Reports dataset. Details about the incident and responding police district are included, but information about the neighborhood is not.
Provided by the same department is a dataset of police districts in Boston, containing police district idenfication numbers and the neighborhood they serve. By matching crimes to neighborhoods using the police district id, we can get an idea of how safe a neighborhood is based on how much crime there is.
