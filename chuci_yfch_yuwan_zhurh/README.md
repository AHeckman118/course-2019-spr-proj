Description:
For our Unemployment and Governor Election dataset, we did a projection on the Unemployment dataset and
only kept the City and the unployment rate as of Dec 2018 fields. We did the same thing on the Governor dataset
and kept the Town and the voting percentage for Charlie Baker (2018 MA governor election) fields.
The City and the Town fields are the keys in these two datasets and they have the exactly same 
contents, which is the name of all the towns in Massachusetts. Finally, we join the two datasets
together by using the Town field as key and show the unemployment rate and supporting rate for 
Charlie Baker. The result dataset can help us to observe the relationship between the unemployment rate
and supporting rate for a Republican governor. Therefore, political analysts will be able to use
this dataset to understand which party did unemployed people really support.
