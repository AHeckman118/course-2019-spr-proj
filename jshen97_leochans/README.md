<b>The Geo-Analysis of Franchising brands in Boston </b><br>

a.     General Description:
The project picks one or two most popular franchising brand(s) in Boston (i.e. CVS, Walgreen, KFC, Burger King, Macdonald, etc.) 
to generate/acquire a “target” dataset based on its geographical location. Experiment/Integrate the dataset with other available 
geo-location related “guest” datasets (i.e. crime rate, traffic(accidents) map, rent, migration, etc.) to see if it produces some 
interesting results.
 
b.     Methodology:
Presume a relationship between the target dataset and guest datasets (i.e. number of customers per day is inverse proportional to 
crime rate, is proportional to the square of resident income, etc.) then we experiment to see if the hypothesis holds and try to 
explain why or why not.
 
c.	Possible Goals to Achieve:
  i. Answer the question that what is the best location in a new neighborhood like Charlsy?
  ii. Answer the question that how does this brand doing in the area compared with its major competitor?
  iii. Build or provide a model for a possible/imagined local/small-business entrepreneur about the best location to start a similar 
       business.
