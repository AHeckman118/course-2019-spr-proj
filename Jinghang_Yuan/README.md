### Narrative

All these five data sets are about Cambridge, we use them in order to find out the factor that influences the value of properties. We could combine the address of propertie, schools, bus stops, parking lot and receation spots together to answer how the value of properties could be affected. We may also find out how will the value of properties increase/decrease if there are more/less transportation, recreation and schools nearby.
