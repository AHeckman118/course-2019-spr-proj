### Project Goal
How  will future flooding affect Boston?
The city of Boston has made data available showing where flooding will take place at both high tide and during the worst storm surges in future years. We would like to use this information, and apply it to other publicly available sets to discover how the city, its citizens, and industries will be most affected. Specifically, we will combine the flood data with other geographic data, such as zoning to show what types of areas ares will be affected. With this information, we will then be able to look at more specific information about neighborhoods, using census data that will show which demographics will be most affected by flooding, based on where flooding is mapped to residential zones. We will also use traffic data from Uber, which can show us how disruptions in these areas affected traffic in the rest of the city, to demonstrate how the affect of flooding will spread outwards.
