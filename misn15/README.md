## Project #1
For project one, I wanted to look at if parts of Boston were healthier than others and if this was at least partly due to the environment. I retrieved median income fromt the Census Bureau, hazardous waste and oil sites from the Massgov.org, health data from the Centers for Disease and Control, zipcode information from the Census Bureau, and crime data from Analyze Boston. I combined these data sets to see whether certain zipcodes within Boston contained more hazardous waste sites and if these sites were located in areas with more poverty and more health problems. Additionally, I thought it would be interesting to see whether these areas also had higher crime rates. After retrieving this data, I tried to match up Boston zipcodes with the number of hazardous sites, median income, crime rate, and health issues to see whether there was a correlation between these factors.
