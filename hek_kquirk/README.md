Data Set One
---------------
One data set we pulled was a zipped shape file from Harvard Dataverse that contained information about the police districts within Boston. In order to better use the data, we then converted it into a GeoJSON format. In this way, the data will store nicely within MongoDB and will be easier to query. As for the significance of this data, while the data set itself is not interesting, it can be combined with some of our other data sets. One data sets that we could combine are the crime statistics for each district with this data set. This would allow us to better visualize the crime per district. We could also use the race and ethinicity or general neighborhood statistics for us to store more information about each district.

Data Set Two
---------------
Another data set is the race and ethincity data set gathered from census data. Due to the nature of the data (it was presented in a pdf), it was better for us to store the data in a different format and have it on the datamechanics.io site. What is great about this data is that not only does it provide valuable insight into the race and ethnicities that make up each neighborhood of Boston, it can easily be combined with other data sets. For example, we combined it with a data set that matched each Boston neighborhood to a police district. As a result, we are able to come up with a better picture of what the demographics are for each district. This was done through a map reduce function.
