We have 5 data sets:
1) BU-TRANSPORTATION-STUDY
2) Property Assessment
3) Boston Greenhouse Gas Emissions
4) Public Works Active Work Zones
5) Traffic Count Locations
We combine these in three ways, documented below.

Goal: Find correlation between traffic density and people who take the bus  
Justification: Students not taking the bus may be unknowingly contributing to heavier traffic volumes in their area. There may be a correlation between students who do not take the bus and higher traffic volumes. This data can be used by Natick public schools to encourage students in these high traffic volume areas to take the bus to school instead. 
  
Goal: Find correlation between house price and people who take the bus  
Justification: As we have been tasked to find reasons why so many students are not taking the bus, we want to see if there is a correlation between house prices and whether or not a student takes the bus. It may be possible that many families cannot afford to take a bus, or even that families that are well off may not see the value in paying for a bus ride when the parents themselves can take their children to school.
  
Goal: Show the contribution of non-bus vehicles to greenhouse gases  
Justification: This will give us a good idea of the damage cars are causing to the environment, and give us a good number to point at in an argument for the benefits of buses.
