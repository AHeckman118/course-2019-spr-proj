# Taking Gender Equity to the Streets
> Maoxuan Zhu, Dongyi He, Wei Jiang, Kaikang Zhu

This is a Spark! project. Representation is one of MOWA's priority areas. We recognize that male names and pronouns are often the default and given Boston's long parochial history, we want to make sure our City represents its current demographics (52% women). That said, we'd also like to know if there are streets that are good candidates for re-naming (repetitive, etc.).

The goal is to have an interactive site that allows the city and the public to evaluate the different options for renaming based on the different variables provided.  
Most of the needed sets already exist, just need to be analyzed.

## Project #1
In this part we retrived some datasets and managed to transform them into some meaningful datasets using relational primitives.

### Famous People
This dataset comes from [https://www.50states.com/bio/mass.htm](https://www.50states.com/bio/mass.htm). We parsed names of famous people and stored them into MongoDB with their `full_name`, `first_name`, `last_name` and `middle_name`.
